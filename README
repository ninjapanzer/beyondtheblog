CakePHP is a great rapid development framework, and the blog tutorial is a fine
starting point on any journey to learn it.  A tutorial covering a few more of
the dirty realities of an actual project would have been a welcome next step in
my first CakePHP encounter.  This series aspires to being that next step.
